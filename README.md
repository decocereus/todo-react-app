# Welcome to my first React app built with Firebase with a real time database update and full CRUD functionality. 

The app can be accessed here: [To-Do Apps](https://todo-react-p1.web.app/)

# To run the app you need npm, then run:

  - npm install 
  - npm install @material-ui/core
  - npm install @material-ui/core/icons
  - npm run 
  
### You have to install *firebase* tools and setup the backend for the app to work properly. 

This app supports full CRUD functionality

# Once you are done with the task simply delete it! 

I would love to hear any feedback about the application!
